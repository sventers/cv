    As a senior, I dropped out and enlisted in the Air Force.
    At the time, I was a bit unreasonably scared I would end up building vending machines and microwaves the rest of my life.

    I thought that the inter world war period and it's stress had formed the creators of many of our current systems and numerous artists eg 
    - Shannon and Von Neuman in computational theory
    - developments in atomic physics
    - Keynes and modern economic theory
    - Wittgenstein and linguistic philosophy
    
    and thought the military would grow my perspective on life.
