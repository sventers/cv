    Seach tool for the next finding place to stay during long time traveling.
  description: |
    During constant traveling the last two years, I realized the need for a better way to search for where to stay.  If you stay at the right places, the backpacking community has wonderful tips on what to do.

    Implemented machine learning algorithm to sort hostels by similarity, and users sort by inputting their favorite hostels. Feedback from user searches goes into lodging similarity matrix. Searches is based on ranking within a subset of geographically available travel options tomorrow.
